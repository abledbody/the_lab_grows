--- correspond to a particular frame. If any data is at frame index -1, it will
--- be used for every frame of the animation.
--- @field duration [number] An array indicating how long it takes for each frame to elapse. Does not support index -1.

--- Advances the time of the animator by dt.
--- @param self Animator The animator.
--- @param dt number The time to advance by.

--- If there is data at index -1 of the array at that key, that is returned regardless of the current frame index.

	--- @field frame_advances integer How many times the frame index has incremented during the last call to `advance`.
	--- @field ended boolean Whether or not the last call to `advance` advanced past the end of the animation.

--- Generates an animation by a rule function.
--- @param length integer The number of frames to add to the animation.
--- @param rule fun(frame_i:integer):{duration:number} A function which takes in a frame index and returns a table with all the keys and values for that frame. The `duration` key is always required.
